## About the game

### General description
Your goal is to reach the water. You also need to avoid enemies.
If you collide with an enemy - you lose one life.
If you lose your last life - the game is ended.

Every time you reach water - you earn points. Every time you earn a point there is a chance that you'll have a new enemy or they'll speed up.
You also have a chance of getting a benefit.

### Enemies
You have two types of enemies: Bug (red) and Master Bug (blue).
Master bug usually moves faster and more unpredictable. They are also more aggressive.
